        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>Our story began in July 2022, but it wasn’t until 2023 that I saw her for the first time in person in 2023. I remember that moment so clearly—when I saw her, it felt like a dream, as if time had stopped just for us. </p>
        <p>We spent my birthday together, and it was everything I could have hoped for and more. From laughing, talking, and simply being in each other’s presence, it was perfect. One of the most unforgettable moments was when I managed to sneak her into my place, even though it wasn’t exactly “by the book.”</p>
        <p> We shared a secret moment, one that only made our connection even stronger Since then, our love has only grown stronger with each passing day. Every moment shared brings us closer, and we’re excited for the future we’re building together, hand in hand.</p>
